Schematic representation of the hormonal axis. Arrows and bar-headed lines indicate excitatory and inhibitory connections, respectively.
Here $H(t)$ is the input from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus,
$x(t)$, $y(t)$, $z(t)$ are serum concentrations of the hypothalamic, pituitary and target gland hormones, respectively.
